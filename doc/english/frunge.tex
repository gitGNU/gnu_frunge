\addpart{Frunge Fonts Project}

We at the Frunge Fonts Project want to create free, high-quality and Unicode
complete ſubſtitutes to the proprietary blackletter fonts. Frunge is an
abbreviation of the German “FRei UNd GEbrochen” (= free and blackletter).

Therefore it is pronounced [fʁʊŋə]. But as we tend to pronounce the Gentium SIL
not as [dʒɛntɪʊm], but rather as [gɛntɪʊm] or even [gɛntsɪʊm], you may feel free
to pronounce it as [frʌndʒ], or as you like it.

We alſo found out, that ſome online dictionaries define frunge as “neck
maſſage”. This is what it gives us when we finiſhed a font :)



\addpart{We Care About Your Freedom}

Blackletter fonts are uſually very expenſive. Even if not, you may not ſtudy,
change or even rediſtribute modified verſions :(

Becauſe we didn’t want to wait until thoſe publiſhers relicenſe their fonts as
free ſoftware, we ſtarted this project. A little bit preſſure can help them, as
well ;)

Our fonts are free ſoftware, i. e. you may

\begin{itemize}
\item use
\item ſtudy
\item modify / improve and
\item rediſtribute them.
\end{itemize}

Uſually you can get them without fee.

We want to enſure, that our fonts cannot be made proprietary again, ſo we
chooſed to licenſe them under a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft}{copyleft} licenſe:

To avoid licenſe proliferation and to enſure greateſt font combining
poſſibilities, our fonts are licenſed under GPL, ((OFL)) (and CC-BY-SA?). %If
%you feel that this is not enough, pleaſe \hyperlink{contact}{contact} us.

If you want to want to rediſtribute our fonts (probably changed), have a look at
the full licenſe text(s) to make ſure, that you meet the conditions!

To maximize your freedom, we added exceptions to our licenſes to avoid ſome
reſtrictions of the vanilla licenſes:

GPL:
\begin{itemize}
\item you may embed this font
%OFL:
%\item you may uſe our font name and
%\item you may ſell our fonts unbundled with other ſoftware
\end{itemize}



\addpart{Feature Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item XeTeX Math Fonts
\item Language specific typography
\item r rotunda
\item Umlauts with superscript e
\end{itemize}



\addpart{Font Faces}

\addsec{Frunge Mixtura}

This is a draft and learning example. Its outlines are drawn as if their ſtrokes
were written with a thick feather, hold by 45 degrees (is to be decreased) only,
in the lower and upper right direction.

It can be altered through options heavily.
…



\addpart{\XeTeX-Usage}

…



\addpart{Internal Implementation}

Accented letters are diſſolved via a ccmp-table and reſurrected by
abvm/etc.-tables. Therefore your font rendering engine ſhould fully ſupport
OpenType (otherwiſe no glyphs are ſhown for thoſe).
…



\addpart{Input of Long s}

Xmodmap
…

Neo – ergonomically optimized keyboard layout for German (and Engliſh);
ſets long s on firſt level and makes blackletter typing eaſy.
